# Once Upon a Time

In the early days of agile development, there were 2 leaders of each agile team. One represented the business
while the other represented the developers. Their duties were clearly assigned and it was clear the group of
stakeholders they spoke for in the agile development process.

Product Owners are still around and getting hired in droves, but Scrumasters have slowly dimished over time where most companies (at least in the US) don't even think about hiring them anymore.

How could a position that was once so valuable have faded into relative obscurity despite being the representative of those on the team who actually do the work?
