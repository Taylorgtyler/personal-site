Hello and welcome. I'm Taylor and I have been working in technology for over 5 years. Lucky for me, I got a job right out of college at a services business trying to transition to being a tech company.

They ended up not succeeding in that transition, but running a company is hard and growing it is almost impossible.

This early experience gave me the opportunity to continue exploring the world of technology and growing my skills in a way that I never could've at a bigger company. Since then, I've been able to keep learning and have been fortunate enough to work with some very talented people solving problems and building innovative data products.

Here, I will be sharing some insights on my journey including my various projects and startups, thoughts on business, life, and economics (my first love). Whether you're looking to collaborate or just want to follow along on my journey through the tech industry, I appreciate your visit and look forward to connecting with you.
