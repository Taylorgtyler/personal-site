# Change

Change is a constant in life, yet something deep inside all of us is hardwired to be wary of it. For some, it's a true aversion. For others, it's a mild discomfort that falls somewhere between missing a green turn arrow and stepping on a Lego while groggy. No matter where someone's aversion to change exists on this spectrum of discomfort, it always exists.

My own relationship with change has evolved over time. I've navigated through multiple professions in my young career and explored various aspirations before that. While it's gotten easier with each reinvention, it's still far from "easy." However, I've discovered a few strategies that can lighten the burden and make pivoting more manageable.

# Let Go

This is first for a reason. It's the single most important part of a good pivot.

### Just let it go.

Acknowledging that you were wrong is okay. It's natural to want to double down and resist pivoting, especially when you've invested time and effort. You might find yourself saying things like "I've put so much time in" or "I'm not a quitter." Resist this urge.

Good card players will tell you that's the surest way to lose money. As someone who's been there, I can tell you it's the easiest way to psyche yourself out of making a necessary change.

Remember: You're not quitting anything other than your approach. Letting go is the first step towards growth.

# Take a Baby step

Choose something in your new goal that requires low effort to achieve and do it. You may be tempted to dismiss certain actions as meaningless or trivial. I made that mistake many times before I finally just picked something and took a shot.

That baby step might seem insignificant in the moment, but it's crucial. No matter how small, short-term, or seemingly unscalable it may be, it's worth taking.

Remember: Baby steps turn into giant leaps if given enough time and consistency.

# Come up with a Plan

Develop a loose roadmap for how you'll progress from where you are to where you want to be. It doesn't have to be perfect – it just needs to exist.

Once your first step is out of the way, outline the next few. These subsequent steps should build momentum and keep you moving forward in your pivot.

### Be ready to throw your plan away.

It's impossible to create a flawless plan from the outset. Be willing to rethink your next steps if life presents evidence that they're not the right ones. Regroup and continue moving towards your goal, adjusting your course as needed.

# The Power of Pivoting

It's easy to get stuck, especially when you've invested months, years, or even decades into something you thought was right. The longer you wait to make a change, the more daunting it becomes.

Whether it's a product launch or a personal life decision, the time you've already invested can feel overwhelming. It's true that you may "lose" some of that time in a pivot. However, in the long run, time spent moving towards something you believe in is much better spent than forcing your way into something that isn't working out.

# Conclusion

Pivoting is an art that combines self-awareness, courage, and adaptability. By learning to let go, take small but meaningful steps, and create flexible plans, you can navigate life's changes with greater ease and purpose.

Remember, the ability to pivot effectively is not just a valuable skill in business or careers – it's a life skill that can lead to personal growth, new opportunities, and a more fulfilling journey. Embrace the art of pivoting, and you'll find yourself better equipped to handle whatever twists and turns life throws your way.
