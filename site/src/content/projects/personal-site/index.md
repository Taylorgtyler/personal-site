I wanted a content driven site that could be statically hosted and perform well. This site will house my blog and links to projects I'm working on in my free time.

It's fully SEO optimized, styled with tailwing, and has a perfect lighthouse score.

There's also tracking set up through [umami](https://umami.is/).
